//setup..this is similar to when we use our default tages in html
const express = require('express');
//activate or tell this app variable to be an express server
const app = express();
const router = express.Router();

//start the web server....app.listen(portnumber,function
app.listen(3000, function(){
    console.log('Listening on port 3000')
})

//making an api using routes
//Routes are used to handle browser requests. They look like URLs. The difference is that when a browser 
// requests a route, it is dynamicaally handled by using a function.
//GET or a regular request when someone goes to http://localhost:3000/hello. When using a function in a route,
//we almost always have a parameter or handle a response and request
