//making an api using routes
//Routes are used to handle browser requests. They look like URLs. The difference is that when a browser 
// requests a route, it is dynamicaally handled by using a function.
//GET or a regular request when someone goes to http://localhost:3000/hello. When using a function in a route,
//we almost always have a parameter or handle a response and request
